# 2048-V.2-Remastered
OBJ:<br/>Before I enrolled in SE KMITL I liked to play 2048 because it is a fun game that has a simple rule but very hard to win style.<br/>
That's is why I'd like to create my own 2048 from scratch and I want to improve with some features.<br/>
Not to mention that it is a good opportunity for me to practice my basic skill of programming.<br/>
Features
1. The normal gameplay that you would normally have<br/>
2. The UI for the game<br/>
3. The Userdata - Finished<br/>
4. Leader board<br/>
5. Save profile picture - Finished<br/>
6. Menu<br/>
7. Personal score - Finished<br/>
8. Change password - Finished<br/>
9. Change user<br/>

Todo-list tmrw<br/>

2. Clear the main code<br/>
3. Finish design UI<br/>
