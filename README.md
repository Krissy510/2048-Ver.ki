# What is 2048 Ver.ki
2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game written by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli and published on GitHub. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
# Purpose
Before I enrolled in SE KMITL I liked to play 2048 because it is a fun game that has a simple rule but very hard to win style.<br/>
That's is why I'd like to create my own 2048 from scratch and I want to improve with some features.<br/>
Not to mention that it is a good opportunity for me to practice my basic skill of programming.
